# Exercises

Make sure you understand the feature you are analysing for vulnerabilities.
Before attempting any exploits, walk the "happy path" and investigate if the feature works as expected.


## Zero Stars

Give a devestating zero-start feedback to the store. You find the feedback form at `/#/contact`.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
Can you enable the button with the developer tools?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>
There is another way: Use ZAP to find the request and replay it with a 0 value.
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìö Solution</summary>
Here is the solution...
</details>


## Payback Time

Place an order that makes you rich.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
When you order an item, you pay money. When you sell an item, you are being paid. Basic economics.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>
Have you tried ordering a negative amount of items?
</details>


## Confidential Document

Access a confidential document.
Reading the about us (`/#/about`) might nudge you in the right direction.


<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
Robots are certainly disallowed to access confidential files.
How would you tell google to hide a directory?
</details>


## View Basket

You need some inspiration on what to buy. View another user's shopping basket.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
Observe the HTTP traffic using ZAP when shopping. Is there a request with an interesting parameter that you could change in your favor?
</details>


## Forged Review

Privacy is important. Post a product review as another user or edit any user's existing review.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
Observe the HTTP traffic using ZAP while submitting a review for the "Apple Juice". Can you alter any interesting parameters when sending a request to `/rest/products/1/reviews`?
</details>


## Login Admin

Sometimes it is boring to be a normal user. Login as the administrator (admin@juice-sh.op) instead.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
User credentials are generally stored in a database, can you perform an injection that results in a positive query reply?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>
Don't forget to comment out the trash after the injected commands.
</details>


## User Credentials

Data is power. Steal all user credentials by abusing the search functionality.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 0 (the endpoint)</summary>
The vulnerable (legacy) search endpoint is located under the following path `/rest/products/search?q=<SEARCH QUERY>`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
The endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injections.
When exploiting a SQL injection, make sure that you know how to properly close the query.
Start by crafting a simple query that doesn't result in an error (e.g. does `test';--` work, or are there for instance any open brackets left?)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>
Exploit the SQLi by crafting an `UNION SELECT` query to join the data from another table to the results.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 3</summary>
Use the `sqlite_schema` table to extract the relevant table names.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 4</summary>
Use the `PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('TABLE NAME GOES HERE')` table to extract the relevant column names.
</details>


## NoSQL Manipulation

Look at the endpoint `PATCH /rest/products/reviews`.
Update multiple product reviews at the same time.

```javascript
module.exports = function productReviews () {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const user = security.authenticatedUsers.from(req)
    db.reviews.update(
      { _id: req.body.id },
      { $set: { message: req.body.message } },
      { multi: true }
    ).then(
      result => {
        res.json(result)
      }, err => {
        res.status(500).json(err)
      })
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/">`db.collection.update` documentation</a>
and the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/">query operators documentation</a>.

Which query allows you to change multiple reviews at the same time?
</details>


## Null-Byte Injection

Download `/ftp/package.json.bk`.
Note node.js handles null-bytes differently than the underlying library which is written in C.

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 1</summary>
In C strings are terminated by a NULL byte.
Thus the string "hello.txt‚ñ†.md" (with ‚ñ† representing the NULL byte) will be seen as "hello.txt‚ñ†.md" in node.js, but as "hello.txt" in the low level library that opens the file.
How can this be exploited, when the access verification happens in node.js?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùì Hint 2</summary>
A url encoded null byte is represented as "%00", however, make sure you properly encode it when submitting the request.
